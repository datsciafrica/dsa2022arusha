 - {title: "Embedded ML - Tiny ML", image: "TinyML_2022.jpg", text: "TinyML is a cutting-edge field that brings the transformative power of machine learning (ML) to the performance- and power-constrained domain of tiny devices and embedded systems. Successful deployment in this field requires intimate knowledge of applications, algorithms, hardware, and software." }
 - {title: "Summer School", image: "summer_school.jpg", text: "In the tradition of previous Data Science Africa  events, a summer school on machine learning and data science will be held prior to the main workshop. This summer school will target graduate students, researchers, and professionals working with huge amounts of data or unique datasets. The summer school will focus on introductory and advanced lectures in data science and machine learning as well as moderate to advanced practical and tutorial sessions where participants will get their hands wet wrangling and munging datasets and apply cutting edge machine learning techniques to derive inference from the data..
" }
 - {title: "Workshop", image: "Workshop_2022.jpg", text: "The workshop will be organized around paper presentations and interactive panel discussions. The theme for the workshop is Data, Technology, and Community. We want to highlight the work of the community in Data Science in Africa. We strongly encourage the participation of researchers and data science communities from across the continent. We invite participants interested in presenting work at the workshop to submit a short abstract describing the application of data science methods to problems relevant to Africa." }

Unveiled in 1907, this 72-ton bronze statue is reputed to be one of the finest equestrian statues in the world. Situated a stone's throw from St Cyprian's Cathedral (on a road island bordered by Du Toitspan Road, Regiment Way and d'Arcy Street) this bronze work by Hamo Thornycroft depicts Rhodes mounted on his horse with a map of Africa in his hands. Facing to the north, it is symbolic of Rhodes’ imperialist vision of extending the British Empire deep into the African hinterland. Rhodes is depicted in the clothes he wore at the memorable indaba with the Matabele indunas (leaders) in the Matopos in the 1880s."}

aboutUs: "The last few years have witnessed an explosion in the quantity and variety of data available in Africa, produced either as a by-product of digital services, from sensors or measuring devices, satellites and from many other sources. A number of practical fields have been transformed by the ability to collect large volumes of data: for example, bioinformatics with the development of high throughput sequencing technology capable of measuring gene expression in cells, or agriculture with the widespread availability of high quality remote sensing data. For other data sources – such as mobile phone usage records from telecoms operators, which can be used to measure population movement and economic activity – we are just beginning to understand the practical possibilities."

The session will start with an introduction to air pollution, its effects, different types of pollutants and air quality sensing technologies. Participants will be able to prototype and deploy an IoT device that is capable of collecting air quality data and transmitting it in real-time to a cloud-based platform for analysis."}
