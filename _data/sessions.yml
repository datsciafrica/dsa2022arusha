#  subtype: presentation
#  description: "Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG) is a multi-institutional initiative using techniques from algorithms, 
#  optimization, and mechanism design, along with insights from other disciplines, to improve access to opportunity 
#  for historically underserved and disadvantaged communities. MD4SG was founded by Rediet Abebe and Kira Goldner 
#  in the fall of 2016 as a small reading group. Since its inception, the group — co-organized by Rediet Abebe, 
#  Irene Lo, Ana-Andreea Stoica, and Francisco Marmolejo — has also grown into a network of over 1000 participants 
#  from 100 institutions and 30 countries who are united by their interest to use an interdisciplinary approach 
#  to tackle problems of societal importance. The online working groups have served as a backbone of MD4SG over the years. 
#  In this mini-tutorial, we showcase work focused on and relevant to the African continent, as presented by the leaders of 
#  the different working groups. 
#
#  Topics:
#  Climate change (Lily Xu & Wanyi Li),
#  Inequality (Samuel Taggart),
#  Developing Nations (Francisco Marmolejo-Cossio),
#  Data Economies (Abeba Birhane & George Obaido)
