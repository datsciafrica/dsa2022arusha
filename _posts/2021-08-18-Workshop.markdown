Due to the COVID-19 pandemic this yearâ€™s DSA event will also be virtual, starting on the 4th of October, hosted by Sol Plaatje University located in Kimberley, Northern Cape South Africa. We believe that the DSA community of both past and new participants can still benefit greatly from the virtual event. 

The DSA Kimberley event will consist of oral presentations of data science applications from academia and industry and interactive panel discussions.

The theme for the summer school is Women and Data in Africa. We want to improve the gender balance in Data Science in Africa, by empowering women and by encouraging men to consider their role as male allies. We strongly encourage the participation of women from across the continent..

We are also using this platform as a call for abstracts for the workshop. Abstracts should cover relevant topics including but not limited to:

* Data Science for the Sustainable Development Goals
* Health care
* Agriculture
* Wildlife conservation
* Disaster response
* Geo-spatial modeling
* Telecommunications data modeling
* Economic monitoring
* New data science and machine learning methods
* COVID related applications
* Language modeling

The workshop is scheduled for 7th - 8th October 2021 <a href="https://forms.gle/kZBsV5NgKoYpnYsB9">registration is open</a>
