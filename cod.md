__This "Don't be a jerk" policy is a shortened, more casual version of the longer Code of Conduct policy. [Read full version](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_jerk).__


DSA prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means jerky behavior isn’t allowed at DSA meetings. Because we know that it’s not obvious to everyone, here’s a reminder of the things we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop. Continuous jerky behavior may result in getting expelled from the meeting.

If someone is bothering you, please tell DSA Organizers immediately and they will take care of it.
